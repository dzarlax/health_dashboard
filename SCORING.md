# Health Dashboard — Scoring & Calculation Logic

All calculations run server-side in `internal/health/scoring.go → ComputeBriefing()`.
Data is fetched by `internal/storage/briefing.go → GetHealthBriefing()`.

---

## Data window

Every metric is fetched for the **last 30 days** relative to the most recent date that has any data in the DB (not today's date — data can be stale).

Two different "recent" and "baseline" definitions are used depending on context:

**Readiness score & Recovery section** (require ≥ 9 days):
- **"Recent"** = average of the last **7 days** (index 0–6, most recent first)
- **"Baseline"** = average of days **8–30** (index 7 onward) — recent days are **excluded** from the baseline to prevent dilution

**Sleep / Activity / Cardio sections & Metric cards** (require ≥ 3 days):
- **"Recent"** = average of the last **3 days** (index 0–2)
- **"Baseline"** = average of **all 30 days** (including recent) — simpler because these sections use point-based or absolute-value scoring, not ratio-based

**% change** = `(recent − baseline) / baseline × 100`

> **Why 7 for "recent"?** The 7-day rolling average is the consensus recommendation for HRV-guided training decisions [[18]](#ref-18) [[19]](#ref-19). It aligns with the ACWR acute window [[2]](#ref-2) and fully covers the 72-hour post-exercise HRV suppression window [[1]](#ref-1) while reducing single-day noise. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the 7-day window is also a strong indicator of overreaching [[18]](#ref-18).

> **Why 9 total for Readiness?** With 7 recent days and only 1 baseline day, the baseline is a single data point. Requiring at least 2 baseline days (9 total) ensures a meaningful comparison. Section cards use simpler absolute or point-based logic so 3 days is sufficient.

---

## Readiness Score (0–100)

Shown as the big number in the hero card.

```
readiness = HRV_score × 0.40 + RHR_score × 0.30 + Sleep_score × 0.30
```

All three sub-scores use the same **ratio model**: `score = clamp(70 + (ratio − 1) × 150, 0, 100)`

This means:
- A perfectly average day (ratio = 1.0) → **70**
- ~10% above baseline (ratio = 1.10) → **85**
- ~20% above baseline (ratio = 1.20) → **100**
- ~15% below baseline (ratio = 0.85) → **47**
- ~33% below baseline (ratio = 0.67) → **~5**

A score of 100 is genuinely exceptional, not the default.

> **Why HRV 40% / RHR 30% / Sleep 30%?** WHOOP's published methodology states HRV should be the single biggest recovery factor [[3]](#ref-3). Marco Altini's HRV4Training model uses HRV at roughly double the weight of RHR [[4]](#ref-4), implying a ~2:1 HRV:RHR ratio — matching this codebase's 40:30 ratio. Oura analysis suggests RHR explains ~29% of readiness variance [[5]](#ref-5), consistent with the 30% weight.

### HRV sub-score (0–100)

`ratio = recent_HRV / baseline_HRV`

Applied directly to the ratio model (higher HRV = better).

> Using personal baseline rather than population norms is the recommended approach for HRV interpretation: individual longitudinal changes are more meaningful than cross-sectional comparisons [[6]](#ref-6) [[7]](#ref-7).

### Resting HR sub-score (0–100)

`ratio = baseline_RHR / recent_RHR`  ← inverted because lower RHR is better

Applied to the ratio model.

### Sleep sub-score (0–100)

Blends two components equally (50/50):

**Absolute component** — based on recent average sleep duration [[8]](#ref-8) [[9]](#ref-9), with oversleep penalty [[20]](#ref-20):

| Recent avg sleep | Score |
|---|---|
| ≥ 10.0 h | 40 (oversleep penalty) |
| ≥ 9.5 h | 60 (oversleep penalty) |
| ≥ 9.0 h | 80 (oversleep penalty) |
| ≥ 8.0 h | 95 |
| ≥ 7.5 h | 85 |
| ≥ 7.0 h | 75 |
| ≥ 6.5 h | 60 |
| ≥ 6.0 h | 45 |
| ≥ 5.5 h | 30 |
| < 5.5 h | 15 |

> **Why penalize oversleep?** A 2025 meta-analysis of 79 cohort studies (Li et al.) found that sleep ≥ 9 hours is associated with **34% higher all-cause mortality** (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.26–1.42) — a stronger effect than short sleep (14% higher, HR 1.14). The U-shaped mortality curve means both extremes carry risk. The penalty is applied as a cap on the absolute score using `math.Min` so it only reduces, never raises [[20]](#ref-20).

**Relative component** — `ratio = recent_sleep / baseline_sleep`, applied to the ratio model.

`sleep_score = abs_score × 0.5 + rel_score × 0.5`

### Readiness labels

| Score | Label | Tip |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 80 | Optimal | Great day for a challenging workout |
| ≥ 50 | Fair | Moderate activity is fine; listen to your body |
| < 50 | Low | Focus on recovery, avoid intense exercise |

### Recovery % bar
`recovery_pct = readiness_score` (same value, displayed as a progress bar)

---

## Readiness History

Available at `GET /api/readiness-history?days=N` (default 30, max 365).

For each output day D, the score is computed using a **sliding 30-day window**: HRV, RHR, and sleep_total values for D and the 29 days before D, sorted most-recent-first (D is index 0). The same `computeReadiness` formula applies.

**Important**: the `valsBefore` helper in `briefing.go` sorts days by **date** descending, so index 0 is always the most recent calendar day — not the highest-value day. An earlier bug sorted by value, which inflated "recent" averages.

---

## Section cards (Recovery / Sleep / Activity / Heart & Lungs)

Each section has its own point-based score that maps to **good / fair / low**.

**Important**: Section cards use different window parameters than Readiness:
- **Recovery**: 5-day recent, baseline = days 6+ (same as Readiness) — requires ≥ 7 days
- **Sleep / Activity / Cardio**: 3-day recent, baseline = all 30 days — requires ≥ 3 days

### Recovery section

Inputs: HRV and Resting HR (≥ 7 days required per metric).

#### HRV threshold — dynamic ±1 SD

Instead of a fixed ±5% threshold, the HRV threshold is computed from the **standard deviation of the baseline window** (days 6+):

```
thresholdPct = stddev(HRV_baseline) / mean(HRV_baseline) × 100
```

Clamped to [3%, 15%] to handle sparse or very stable data.

| Condition | Points |
|---|---|
| HRV recent > baseline + thresholdPct | +2 |
| HRV recent within ±thresholdPct of baseline | +1 |
| HRV recent < baseline − thresholdPct | +0 |
| RHR recent < baseline − 2% | +2 |
| RHR recent within −2% to +3% of baseline | +1 |
| RHR recent > baseline + 3% | +0 |

Max possible: 4 points (if both metrics available).

| Ratio (score / max) | Status |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.75 | good |
| ≥ 0.40 | fair |
| < 0.40 | low |

> **Why dynamic SD threshold?** A fixed 5% threshold ignores individual HRV variability. Someone with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2% would trigger "below baseline" on normal fluctuation noise; someone with CV 20% would rarely trigger it even when meaningfully depleted. A ±1 SD threshold (as a % of baseline) adapts to each person's natural day-to-day variability, giving fewer false positives for high-CV individuals and fewer missed detections for low-CV individuals [[4]](#ref-4) [[6]](#ref-6).

**Trend arrows on detail rows:**
- HRV: up if > threshold, down if < −threshold, otherwise stable
- RHR: inverted — up (good) if < −3%, down (bad) if > +3%

---

### Sleep section

Inputs: sleep_total, sleep_deep, sleep_rem, sleep_awake (≥ 3 days required).
Baseline here is `avg(all available days)` — the sleep section uses a simple
duration-based point scale, not the ratio model.

**Duration score** [[8]](#ref-8):

| Recent avg sleep | Points |
|---|---|
| ≥ 7 h | +3 |
| ≥ 6 h | +2 |
| ≥ 5 h | +1 |
| < 5 h | +0 |

**Deep sleep score** (% of total sleep):

| Deep % | Points |
|---|---|
| ≥ 15% | +2 |
| ≥ 10% | +1 |
| < 10% | +0 |

**Awake time bonus:**

| Recent avg awake | Points |
|---|---|
| < 0.5 h | +1 |

**Sleep regularity bonus** (≥ 7 days required) [[10]](#ref-10):

| stddev(sleep_duration over window) | Points |
|---|---|
| ≤ 0.5 h | +1 |
| > 0.5 h | +0 |

Max possible: 7 points.

| Total points | Status |
|---|---|
| ≥ 5 | good |
| ≥ 3 | fair |
| < 3 | low |

> **Why sleep regularity?** A 2024 meta-analysis (PMC10782501, n ≈ 60 000) found the Sleep Regularity Index predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality more strongly than mean sleep duration (HR 0.97 vs 0.99 per SD improvement) [[10]](#ref-10). Irregular sleep schedules disrupt circadian rhythm independent of total duration.

**REM display** (not scored, shown for info):
- Ideal: ≥ 20% of total sleep
- Formula: `recent_rem / recent_total × 100`

**Consistency display** (shown when ≥ 7 days of data):
- Value: `±Xh` (standard deviation of sleep duration)
- Trend: up if ≤ 0.5h SD, down if > 1.0h SD, stable otherwise

---

### Activity section

Inputs: step_count (SUM), active_energy (SUM), apple_exercise_time (SUM).

**Steps score:**

| Steps recent vs baseline | Points |
|---|---|
| Within −10% or better | +2 |
| Within −30% | +1 |
| Below −30% | +0 |

**Active calories score:** same thresholds as steps.

**Exercise time score:**

| Recent avg exercise | Points |
|---|---|
| ≥ 30 min/day | +2 |
| ≥ 15 min/day | +1 |
| < 15 min/day | +0 |

Max possible: 6 points (if all three metrics available).

| Ratio | Status |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.70 | good |
| ≥ 0.40 | fair |
| < 0.40 | low |

---

### Heart & Lungs section

Inputs: blood_oxygen_saturation (AVG), vo2_max (AVG), respiratory_rate (AVG).

**SpO₂ score** [[11]](#ref-11) [[12]](#ref-12):

| Recent avg SpO₂ | Points |
|---|---|
| ≥ 95% | +2 |
| ≥ 92% | +1 |
| < 92% | +0 |

> The 95% threshold matches the WHO action threshold [[12]](#ref-12). The 92–95% partial-credit band reflects the BTS guideline floor: below 92% is hypoxaemia for most adults, while 92–95% indicates reduced respiratory reserve [[11]](#ref-11).

**VO₂ Max score** [[13]](#ref-13) [[14]](#ref-14):

| VO₂ Max % change vs baseline | Points |
|---|---|
| > −3% | +2 |
| > −8% | +1 |
| ≤ −8% | +0 |

> VO₂ max is recognised by the AHA as a clinical vital sign [[14]](#ref-14). A 122 000-patient study found each 1-MET improvement in CRF reduces all-cause mortality risk by ~13% [[13]](#ref-13). Consumer wearable VO₂ estimates have ±10–15% error vs. lab measurement — trend tracking is more reliable than absolute values.

**Respiratory rate score** [[15]](#ref-15):

| Recent avg RR | Points |
|---|---|
| 12–20 br/min (normal) | +2 |
| 10–24 br/min (borderline) | +1 |
| Outside 10–24 | +0 |

> 12–20 br/min is the universally agreed adult resting normal (StatPearls, ALA, Cleveland Clinic) [[15]](#ref-15).

Max possible: 6 points.

| Ratio | Status |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.70 | good |
| ≥ 0.40 | fair |
| < 0.40 | low |

---

## Overall status

Aggregates the statuses of all available sections.

| Condition | Overall |
|---|---|
| 2 or more sections are "low" | low |
| fair + low sections > good sections | fair |
| otherwise | good |

---

## Metric cards (top row)

5 cards: Steps, Sleep, HRV, Resting HR, Respiratory Rate.

Each card shows:
- **Value**: **today's** value (`vals[0]`, most recent day)
- **Trend %**: `(today − baseline) / baseline × 100`, rounded to 1 decimal
  where baseline = `avg(all 30 days)`
- **Trend label**: positive if > +3%, negative if < −3%, neutral otherwise

---

## Activity vs Recovery chart (Correlation)

Shows the last **7 days** where both step count and HRV data exist on the same calendar day.

- **Load axis (left, %)**: daily step count normalized to the week's max steps
  Formula: `steps_day / max_steps_in_week × 100`
- **HRV axis (right, ms)**: daily average HRV in milliseconds

Only days where **both** metrics have data are plotted. If fewer than 2 matching days exist, the chart is hidden.

> ⚠️ Note: this chart shows correlation visually but does not compute a statistical correlation coefficient.

---

## Weekly Insights (up to 3)

### Insight 1 — Step consistency
Counts how many of the last 7 days had steps ≥ the 30-day average.

- ≥ 5 days → positive: "You hit your average step count on N of the last 7 days"
- < 5 days → warning: "Only N of 7 days above your average steps"

Requires: ≥ 7 days of step data.

### Insight 2 — HRV resilience after hard days
For each day in the overlapping steps/HRV window:
- A day is "high activity" if steps > 1.2 × 30-day average
- The **following day's** HRV is checked against the 30-day HRV average
- If following-day HRV < 95% of average → counted as "HRV dropped"

Array indexing: both slices are most-recent-first. Index `i` = today, `i+1` = yesterday.
Code checks `steps[i+1]` (yesterday was high-activity) → checks `hrv[i]` (today's HRV dropped).

Requires: ≥ 2 high-activity days in the window.

- If > half of high-activity days caused an HRV drop → warning
- Otherwise → positive

> Post-exercise HRV suppression typically lasts 48–72 hours and is a documented marker of autonomic stress [[1]](#ref-1). Chronic suppression (multiple high-activity days with persistent HRV drop) is associated with overreaching syndrome [[16]](#ref-16).

### Insight 3 — Sleep on active vs rest days
Splits the last 30 days into "active" (steps > average) and "rest" days, compares average sleep duration.

- Active sleep avg > rest sleep avg + 0.5 h → positive
- Rest sleep avg > active sleep avg + 0.5 h → warning
- Within 0.5 h → no insight generated

Requires: ≥ 7 days of both steps and sleep data, and at least 1 day in each category.

### Insight 4 — Overtraining warning
**High priority** — inserted at the front of the insight list so it always survives the 3-insight cap.

- Condition: `Activity status == "good"` AND `Readiness score < 50`
- Message: "Your activity is high despite signs of exhaustion. Risk of overtraining is elevated." (type: warning)

---

## Sleep Analysis panel

Shows averages over the last **3 nights**:

| Field | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Deep sleep | avg(sleep_deep last 3 days) — in hours |
| REM sleep | avg(sleep_rem last 3 days) — in hours |
| Awake time | avg(sleep_awake last 3 days) — in hours |
| Efficiency | `(total_sleep − awake) / total_sleep × 100` — green if ≥ 85% |

---

## Multi-device deduplication (all SUM metrics)

When two wearables (e.g. Apple Watch + RingConn) both record the same day, raw `SUM` would double-count. **All SUM metrics** (steps, calories, sleep, exercise time, distance, etc.) use a **MAX-per-source** pattern:

```sql
SELECT MAX(source_sum)
FROM (
    SELECT date, source, SUM(qty) AS source_sum
    FROM metric_points WHERE metric_name = ? ...
    GROUP BY date, source
)
GROUP BY date
```

This picks the device with the highest daily total for each day, avoiding double-counting. Applied consistently in: `GetHealthBriefing`, `GetMetricData`, `GetDashboard`, `GetSleepSummary`, `GetReadinessHistory`, `GetLatestMetricValues`, `BuildDailyMetrics`.

SUM metrics are defined in `internal/storage/aggregates.go::SumMetrics`: step_count, active_energy, basal_energy_burned, apple_exercise_time, apple_stand_time, flights_climbed, walking_running_distance, time_in_daylight, apple_stand_hour, sleep_total, sleep_deep, sleep_rem, sleep_core, sleep_awake.

---

## Health Alerts (anomaly detection)

Alerts are **not score components** — they flag potential health issues based on statistical deviations from personal baselines. They appear in the `alerts` field of the briefing response.

### Respiratory rate anomaly [[21]](#ref-21) [[22]](#ref-22)

Triggers when the 7-day average RR deviates **> 2 SD** from the baseline (days 8+). Requires ≥ 9 days of RR data.

RR elevation often appears **1–2 days before** other markers during infection. Mishra et al. (2024) achieved 95% specificity for respiratory infection detection using a multi-signal algorithm (HR, RR, HRV). Used as an alert rather than a score component because false positives can be triggered by exercise, poor sleep, stress, and alcohol.

### Wrist temperature anomaly [[23]](#ref-23) [[24]](#ref-24)

Triggers when the 7-day average wrist temperature deviates **> 2 SD** from the baseline. Requires ≥ 9 days of data.

Temperature anomalies as small as 0.4°C over 2–3 weeks can be detected with < 10% error rate (Fuller et al. 2024, n = 63,153). Useful for early fever/inflammation detection. Not all users have Apple Watch wrist temperature data — the alert gracefully degrades if data is unavailable.

### HRV coefficient of variation (CV) [[18]](#ref-18) [[19]](#ref-19)

Triggers when the 7-day HRV CV exceeds **15%**, suggesting autonomic instability or overreaching.

The CV of the 7-day rolling average is a strong indicator of maladaptation to training load (Plews et al. 2012, 2014). High CV indicates inconsistent recovery patterns even when the average HRV looks normal. Used as a supplement to the HRV sub-score, which only evaluates the mean.

---

## Known limitations

1. **Readiness requires 9 days minimum** — with fewer days, baseline is too thin to be meaningful. Score defaults to 70 (neutral) if a component has insufficient data.

2. **Section windows differ by design** — Recovery uses 7-day recent / days 8+ baseline (matches Readiness); Sleep / Activity / Cardio use 3-day recent / all-30-day baseline. The 3-day window makes these sections more responsive to acute changes, while the full-window baseline is acceptable because they use point-based or absolute-value scoring rather than ratio-based.

3. **Recovery % = Readiness score** — they are literally the same number, displayed twice (score and progress bar).

4. **Correlation chart is visual only** — no statistical significance is computed.

5. **No absolute step threshold** — the step goal is the personal 30-day average, not a fixed 10,000. Intentional.

6. **Exercise time** — `apple_exercise_time` counts minutes in the Apple Watch Exercise ring, not total movement time.

7. **Readiness History `valsBefore` sorts by date** — an earlier version sorted by metric value, which put the highest-HRV days first and inflated "recent" averages. Fixed: now sorts by calendar date descending.

8. **Consumer SpO₂ accuracy** — consumer pulse oximeters overestimate SpO₂ by 2–3% in people with darker skin pigmentation [[17]](#ref-17). The 92% threshold may represent true saturation of ~89–90% for affected users.

9. **Consumer VO₂ max accuracy** — wearable VO₂ max estimates have ±10–15% error vs. laboratory testing. Trend direction is more reliable than absolute values.

10. **Sleep regularity** — requires ≥ 7 days of sleep data. With fewer days, no regularity bonus or display is shown.

11. **Missing days are excluded, not zero-filled** — if a metric has no data for a given day, that day is skipped entirely in the averaging arrays. This prevents NULL days from artificially depressing scores. Both the `daily_scores` cache path and the `metric_points` fallback path use this approach consistently.

12. **Respiratory rate and wrist temperature not in Readiness** — these are strong illness markers but are only used in the Cardio section card, not in the main Readiness formula. Adding them could improve early illness detection but would also add noise for healthy users.

13. **Timezone changes (travel)** — day boundaries are determined by `substr(date, 1, 10)` which uses the device's local time at recording. When travelling across timezones, Apple Watch/iPhone automatically update the offset (e.g. `+0100` → `+0800`). This means travel days may appear "compressed" (fewer hours when flying east) or "stretched" (more hours when flying west), causing artificially low step counts, calories, and sleep duration for those days. Readiness scores may dip temporarily due to the distorted data. The system self-corrects once 1–2 full days pass in the new timezone. A future improvement could detect mixed timezone offsets within a single day and flag it as a travel day.
